# Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid) Multiclass Semantic Segmentation using Tensorflow 2 GPU 
This repository contains implementations of multiple deep learning models (U-Net, FCN32 and SegNet) for multiclass semantic segmentation of the CamVid dataset
- Implemented tensorflow 2.0 Aplha GPU package

#  Intracranial aneurysm wall segmentation dataset was also tested using the same methods using Tensorflow 2 GPU
Due to the privacy reasons, data and the exact code is not provided but the report is added in this repository.
